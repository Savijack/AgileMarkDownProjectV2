# MarkDown Converter

## Project Description

This program is designed to take in a MarkDown file and convert the test to HTML. The project will be able to convert the following traditional MarkDown syntax into HTML:

- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Italics
- Bold
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Single Lines of Code
- Code Blocks
- Horizontal Lines

Beyond the traditional symbols, the program will convert these custom syntax into HTML:

Once the syntax is converted to HTML, the string will be sent into a new HTML file that can be accessed by the user.
